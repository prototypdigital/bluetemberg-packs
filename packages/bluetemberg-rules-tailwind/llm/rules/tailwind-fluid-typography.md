description: Use fluid utilities (fl-text-{mobile}/{desktop}, fl-py-{mobile}/{desktop}) for body and heading copy and section spacing; never fixed text-/py- steps
scope: "**/*.{tsx,css,ts}"

# Tailwind fluid typography

Fixed type steps (`text-xl`, `py-16`) jump at each breakpoint and leave awkward in-between sizes on the long tail of viewport widths. The `fluid-tailwindcss` plugin interpolates smoothly between a mobile and desktop value, so copy and section rhythm scale with the viewport instead of stepping.

## Rules

- Size body/heading copy with `fl-text-{mobile}/{desktop}` (e.g. `fl-text-base/lg`), not a fixed `text-*` step.
- Set vertical section spacing with `fl-py-{mobile}/{desktop}` (e.g. `fl-py-12/24`), not a fixed `py-*`.
- Fixed steps are fine for non-fluid UI chrome (icons, borders, tight control padding) where interpolation adds nothing — reserve them for that.

## Examples

```tsx
// BAD — fixed steps; size jumps at the sm breakpoint, nothing between
<h1 className="text-3xl sm:text-5xl py-10 sm:py-20">

// GOOD — fluid interpolation between mobile and desktop
<h1 className="fl-text-3xl/5xl fl-py-10/20">
```

## Gotchas

- The `fl-*` utilities require the `fluid-tailwindcss` plugin registered in the Tailwind config — a bare `fl-text-*` with no plugin silently produces no style.
- Don't wrap an `fl-*` utility in a breakpoint variant (`sm:fl-text-*`) — the fluid range already spans breakpoints; doubling up fights itself.
