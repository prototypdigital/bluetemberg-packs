description: Define every Tailwind design token as a CSS variable in the @theme block (colors in OKLch); never hardcode values in class names or inline styles

# Tailwind theme tokens

Hardcoded color/spacing/size values scattered across class names and inline styles drift apart and can't be re-themed in one place. A single `@theme` block of CSS variables is the source of truth Tailwind 4 generates utilities from — bypass it and the design system stops being a system.

## Rules

- Define all design tokens — colors, fonts, spacing, text sizes, radii — as CSS variables inside the `@theme` block. Never write a raw value (`#1a1a1a`, `17px`, `1.375rem`) in a class name or `style={{}}`.
- Express colors in **OKLch** (`oklch(L C H)`), not hex or `rgb()` — OKLch is perceptually uniform, so lightness/chroma adjustments stay visually consistent.
- Reference tokens through the generated utilities (`bg-brand`, `text-muted`) or `var(--color-brand)`; do not re-declare a token's value inline.
- A genuinely one-off value still goes through the theme (add a token) rather than an arbitrary inline literal.

## Examples

```css
/* BAD — raw hex, arbitrary value baked into a class; not themeable */
.hero { background: #0a2540; }
/* <div className="bg-[#0a2540] text-[17px]"> */

/* GOOD — tokens in @theme, expressed in OKLch (shadcn-style semantic names) */
@theme {
  --color-primary: oklch(0.6448 0.2228 26.84);
  --color-muted-foreground: oklch(0.552 0.016 285.938);
}
/* <div className="bg-primary text-muted-foreground"> */
```

## Gotchas

- Tailwind 4's arbitrary-value syntax (`bg-[#...]`, `p-[13px]`) is the escape hatch this rule closes — treat any `[...]` literal in a class as a missing token.
- Converting an existing hex palette: use a hex→OKLch tool once at token-definition time; don't leave both representations in the file.
- shadcn setups often define raw semantic tokens (`--primary`) in `:root` and map them into Tailwind's color namespace with `@theme inline { --color-primary: var(--primary); }` — the generated utility (`bg-primary`) is still what you reference in markup.
