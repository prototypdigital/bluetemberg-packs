# Tailwind breakpoints — single source

When a breakpoint width lives both in the Tailwind theme and as a literal `768` in a `matchMedia`/resize handler, the two drift the moment one changes — JS reacts at a different width than CSS lays out. A single exported `cssVariables.js` keeps the CSS theme and JS logic reading the same numbers.

## Rules

- Define every breakpoint value once in `cssVariables.js` (or the project's single breakpoint module) and import it wherever a breakpoint is needed in JS.
- Never hardcode a breakpoint pixel value as a magic number in component or hook code (`window.matchMedia('(min-width: 768px)')`).
- Feed the same exported values into the Tailwind `@theme` breakpoints so CSS and JS agree.

## Examples

```ts
// BAD — magic number; diverges from the CSS breakpoint when the design changes
const isDesktop = window.matchMedia('(min-width: 768px)').matches

// GOOD — single source imported into JS
import { breakpoints } from '@/cssVariables'
const isDesktop = window.matchMedia(`(min-width: ${breakpoints.md})`).matches
```

## Gotchas

- Keep the unit consistent — if `cssVariables.js` exports `'48rem'`, don't compare against a raw pixel number elsewhere.
- Prefer a CSS-only solution (container queries, `@theme` breakpoints) when no JS actually needs the value; reach for the JS import only when logic genuinely depends on viewport width.
