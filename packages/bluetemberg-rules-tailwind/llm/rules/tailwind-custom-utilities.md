description: Define custom Tailwind utilities with @utility and custom variants with @custom-variant; never hand-roll a global class or duplicate the utility inline

# Tailwind custom utilities

Reusable class logic written as a plain global CSS class sits outside Tailwind's engine — it isn't tree-shaken, doesn't compose with variants, and drifts from the token system. Tailwind 4's `@utility` and `@custom-variant` register reusable utilities/variants the engine knows about, so they participate in variant stacking and purging.

## Rules

- Define a reusable utility (e.g. `.container`, a gradient helper) with `@utility name { … }`, not a bare global `.class { … }`.
- Define a reusable state/condition variant with `@custom-variant name (…)`, not a hand-written selector duplicated across files.
- Build utility bodies from theme tokens (`var(--…)`), not hardcoded values — see [tailwind-theme-tokens](tailwind-theme-tokens.md).

## Examples

```css
/* BAD — plain global class; no variant support, not engine-aware */
.container { margin-inline: auto; max-width: 80rem; padding-inline: 1rem; }

/* GOOD — @utility registers it with the engine; composes with variants */
@utility container {
  margin-inline: auto;
  max-width: var(--container-max);
  padding-inline: var(--container-gutter);
}

/* GOOD — reusable variant instead of repeating a selector */
@custom-variant pointer-fine (@media (pointer: fine));
```

## Gotchas

- `@utility` definitions must live in the Tailwind entry CSS (the file with `@import "tailwindcss"`), not an arbitrary stylesheet, or the engine won't pick them up.
- A custom variant only applies to utilities; it can't wrap arbitrary nested rules — keep its body a single condition.
