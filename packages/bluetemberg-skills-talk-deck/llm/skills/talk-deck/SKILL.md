description: Build an evidence-backed conference deck from a research pack — Slidev scaffold, figures generated from source data, demo risk triage, and a PDF fallback.

# talk-deck

Use this skill when asked to build a conference talk, technical presentation or data-driven deck
where the claims must be defensible.

## Triggers

- "build a deck / slides / presentation for this talk"
- "turn this research into a presentation"
- "prepare a conference submission and deck"
- Any request to present measured findings to an audience, where being wrong in public has a cost

**Not for** internal status decks, sales decks, or slides with no numbers in them. Those need none of
the machinery below.

## Required behavior

1. The agent MUST establish these before scaffolding anything. If any is unknown, ask:
   - **the single claim** the talk makes, in one sentence
   - **the source data**, and whether it is committed and re-derivable
   - **the venue constraints**: talk length, whether Q&A is included, and critically **whose hardware
     the deck runs on**
   - **the deadline**, and whether it is a CFP deadline or a delivery deadline. These are different
     and are usually months apart

2. The agent MUST check the venue's presentation constraints before choosing the stack. If
   presentations run on conference hardware, **live demos are impossible** and this changes the plan
   rather than being a detail to solve later.

3. The agent MUST NOT hand-type figures into slides. Analysis emits structured data; a generator
   builds a single JSON; slides import it. See the `no-hand-typed-figures` rule.

4. The agent MUST create the data pipeline **before** the first slide, and MUST have it print its
   headline figures on every run so a wrong number is visible immediately.

5. The agent MUST verify the deck actually renders, not merely builds. A passing build with a
   runtime-blank slide is a failure. Screenshot or load the pages that carry charts.

6. The agent MUST triage every proposed demo by impact ÷ risk, and MUST prefer a recording over a
   live run for anything involving a network, a model, or a machine that is not the presenter's.

7. The agent MUST produce a PDF export as a fallback and treat it as a deliverable, not a nicety.

8. The agent MUST NOT invent, round up, or smooth a number to make a slide land better. If a figure
   is weaker than hoped, the slide changes, not the figure.

## Structure that works for a findings talk

Five acts. The order matters because each earns the right to the next.

| Act | Job |
|---|---|
| I | Establish stakes and prove the problem is **structural**, not a personal failing |
| II | Destroy the metric the audience expects you to use, using your own worst data point |
| III | Show what replaced it, with the mechanism rather than the vibe |
| IV | Place the work on a named framework, and name that framework's weaknesses yourself |
| V | The gap. What is still missing, volunteered before anyone asks |

**Act V is not optional and is never cut for time.** A talk without it reads as a sales pitch. A
speaker who surfaces their own worst finding is the most credible person in the room; a speaker whose
worst finding is surfaced by an audience member is finished.

## Demo triage

Score by impact ÷ risk, then build in that order:

| Form | Risk | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| Audience participation, slides only | none | Best available. Nothing to fail, and the audience proves your premise on themselves |
| Pre-recorded terminal (VHS, asciinema) | very low | Anything involving a shell. Deterministic, re-recordable, diffable in git |
| On-slide interactive component | low | The data is already local and the interaction is the argument |
| Live terminal | high | Almost never. Fails in front of the largest audience you will have |
| Live model or network call | highest | Never. A failed AI demo inside a talk about AI working is the worst possible outcome |

## Scaffold

```text
deck/
  package.json          # data + dev + build + export scripts
  slides.md             # content only
  scripts/build-data.mjs  # the ONLY place arithmetic happens
  data/                 # generated, gitignored
  components/           # Cite.vue, chart components, interactive widgets
  GOTCHAS.md            # every framework trap hit, so nobody rediscovers them
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "data": "node scripts/build-data.mjs",
    "dev": "npm run data && slidev --open",
    "build": "npm run data && slidev build",
    "export": "npm run data && slidev export --output dist/talk.pdf"
  }
}
```

## Slidev traps that cost real time

Encode these; they all produce confusing errors rather than obvious ones.

- **A slide separator needs a blank line after it.** `---` immediately followed by content gets
  parsed as frontmatter and **the slide silently disappears**. No error, no warning.
- **A top-level `<script setup>` is scoped to slide 1 only.** Each slide compiles as its own
  component, so shared data needs a per-slide import. `app.config.globalProperties` does **not** reach
  slide templates; do not spend time on it.
- **Division inside `{{ }}` is parsed as a regex literal** and breaks the build with
  "Unterminated regular expression". Precompute in the pipeline, which is where arithmetic belongs
  anyway.
- **Interpolations inside `<!-- -->` speaker notes are compiled.** Notes never need live data; write
  literals.
- **`setup/` changes need a server restart.** HMR does not pick them up.

## Checklist before calling the deck done

- [ ] `npm run data` prints every headline figure, and they match the research documents
- [ ] `npm run build` passes, and the chart slides were **loaded and looked at**
- [ ] Every data slide carries a citation with its basis and sample
- [ ] Every chart is titled as a claim and annotates its threshold
- [ ] No number appears in `slides.md` as a literal
- [ ] PDF export tested, **on a machine that is not yours** if the venue supplies hardware
- [ ] Act V exists and is rehearsed flat, not apologetically
- [ ] Corrections logged in the artifact, not silently applied

## Gotchas

- **Build the CFP submission and the deck as separate deliverables on separate timelines.** A
  submission is a title, a summary and a bio. Building slides before acceptance is usually wasted
  work, and CFP deadlines are typically months before delivery.
- **Character limits on submission forms are strict and low**, often 800 or fewer. Draft long, then
  cut to the limit and count programmatically. Leave headroom, because some forms count CRLF line
  endings as two characters.
- **An abstract must not contradict the talk.** If a section argues a metric is meaningless, the
  abstract cannot lead with that metric.
- **The strongest line in any submission is a promise of results that do not exist yet**, when the
  timeline genuinely allows it. "In September this ships and I will bring what happened, including
  whatever breaks" is a reason to attend rather than read the slides later.
- Aggregate any data about colleagues. Per-person charts of identifiable people need their consent,
  and relabelling to "Engineer A" does not anonymise a fourteen-person team whose members are in the
  room.
