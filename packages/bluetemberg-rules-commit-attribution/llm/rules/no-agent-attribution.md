# No agent-attribution residue

A `Co-Authored-By` trailer or a "Generated with Claude Code" footer turns every commit and PR into a visible record of which tool wrote it. That's noise the project didn't ask for, it clutters `git log` and PR history for every future reader, and it's rarely something a team decides on a commit-by-commit basis — it should be an explicit, deliberate choice, not a default left behind by tooling.

## Rules

- Do not add `Co-Authored-By:` trailers naming an AI agent, model, or assistant to commit messages.
- Do not add "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" (or any equivalent tool-attribution footer/banner) to commit messages, PR descriptions, or PR comments.
- This applies to every persisted artifact: commits, PR titles/descriptions, PR/issue comments, and generated files that get committed — not just the commit message.
- If a project or user explicitly asks for attribution to be included, that overrides this rule for that project — but the default, absent that instruction, is no residue.

## Examples

```sh
# BAD — leaves attribution residue in the permanent commit history
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(auth): redirect to /dashboard after login

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"

# GOOD — commit message describes the change only
git commit -m "fix(auth): redirect to /dashboard after login"
```

```md
<!-- BAD — PR description footer -->
## Summary
- Fixes the login redirect bug

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

<!-- GOOD — PR description states the change, nothing else -->
## Summary
- Fixes the login redirect bug
```

## Gotchas

- This is about the *artifact*, not the tool: using an AI assistant to write the change is fine, the rule only concerns what gets left behind in commits/PRs afterward.
- Trailers and footers are easy to reintroduce via commit templates, editor snippets, or CLI defaults — check `git log` output (not just the command you ran) before pushing if a tool's default behavior is unclear.
