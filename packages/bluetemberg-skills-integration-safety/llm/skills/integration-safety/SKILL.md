# integration-safety

Use this skill when wiring a third-party service into a Next.js app: an OAuth/Cognito client, a SOAP endpoint, a captcha or financing widget, an SMTP sender, or any external API. The goal: env and config resolve at runtime not build time, external responses can never throw mid-flow, analytics/widgets degrade silently, and auth cookies are hardened. A flaky integration must never take down page render.

## Triggers

- Creating or editing a client/config for an external service (OAuth, SOAP, SMTP, captcha, financing).
- Validating an external response (REST/JSON, XML/SOAP payload, OAuth token).
- Injecting a third-party `<script>` (captcha, analytics, embedded widget).
- Setting authentication or session cookies.

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Lazy singleton init, never at module load

Next.js standalone builds inject env vars at **runtime**, not build time. A client created at module load reads `undefined`. Create it on first access and cache it.

```ts
// BAD — runs at import time; env vars not yet injected → undefined client
const client = createSoapClient(process.env.SOAP_URL)

// GOOD — lazy singleton; resolves env on first call
let _client: SoapClient | null = null
function getClient() { return (_client ??= createSoapClient(getRequiredEnv('SOAP_URL'))) }
```

### Step 2 — `getRequiredEnv()` for required vars

A missing required env var should fail loudly at the access site, not propagate `undefined` into a request to a third party.

```ts
function getRequiredEnv(key: string): string {
  const v = process.env[key]
  if (!v) throw new Error(`Missing required env var: ${key}`)
  return v
}
```

Read from `process.env` only — never parse a `.env` file in code.

### Step 3 — `safeParse` over `parse` for all external data

External responses are untrusted. `zod.safeParse()` returns `{ success, data, error }` and never throws, so a malformed payload becomes a handled branch instead of a crash.

```ts
// BAD — throws on a malformed external response, unwinding the whole flow
const token = TokenSchema.parse(await res.json())

// GOOD — handled branch; no throw
const parsed = TokenSchema.safeParse(await res.json())
if (!parsed.success) return { error: 'invalid_token_response' }
const token = parsed.data
```

### Step 4 — Fire-and-forget analytics/logging

A tracking or logging call must never break the user-facing flow. Wrap it so its failure is swallowed.

```ts
// GOOD — analytics failure can't fail the search
try { await logSearchQuery(q) } catch { /* analytics is best-effort */ }
```

### Step 5 — Resilient third-party script injection

Load widget scripts dynamically with explicit status, cache in the DOM, attach listeners after mount, and clean up on unmount. A widget error must never block render.

```text
status: idle → loading → ready | error
  - script already in DOM?  reuse it (don't re-fetch)
  - attach listeners after the element mounts
  - return a cleanup that removes listeners on unmount
  - on error → set status='error', render the page WITHOUT the widget
```

### Step 6 — Harden cookies through one constant

Define a single `COOKIE_OPTIONS` (`httpOnly: true`, `secure: true`, `sameSite: 'lax'`) and reuse it. Apply the `__Host-` name prefix in **production only** — it requires HTTPS, which breaks on localhost.

```text
NODE_ENV === 'production'?
  YES → cookie name `__Host-session`, secure cookies over HTTPS
  NO  → plain `session` name (localhost has no HTTPS for __Host-)
```

## Completion checklist

- [ ] External client/config created lazily as a singleton, not at module load
- [ ] Required env vars read via `getRequiredEnv()` from `process.env` (no `.env` parsing)
- [ ] Every external response validated with `safeParse`, not `parse`
- [ ] Analytics/logging wrapped so failure can't break the user flow
- [ ] Widget scripts loaded with idle→loading→ready|error status, DOM-cached, listeners cleaned up; errors don't block render
- [ ] Cookies use one shared hardened `COOKIE_OPTIONS`; `__Host-` prefix gated to production

## When NOT to use

- Purely internal code with no external service, env-dependent client, or untrusted input.
- A one-off server action that doesn't call out to a third party or set cookies.
