description: Default to Server Components and put 'use client' only on the smallest interactive leaf; guard secret-bearing server modules with import 'server-only'
scope: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"

# Next.js server/client boundary

A `'use client'` directive placed high in the tree drags its whole import subtree into the browser bundle; a secret-bearing module with no guard can be imported into a Client Component and leak into that bundle. Keep the boundary explicit and as low in the tree as possible.

## Rules

- **Default to Server Components.** Add `'use client'` only on the smallest leaf that genuinely needs browser APIs, event handlers, or `useState`/`useEffect` — never on a whole page or layout to satisfy one interactive control. Push the directive down so data fetching and static rendering stay above the boundary.
- **Guard modules that must never reach the browser with `import 'server-only'`.** Any module that reads a secret or constructs a server SDK/DB client (auth config, OAuth/Cognito, email transport, DB access) should have `import 'server-only'` at the top — it turns an accidental Client Component import into a build error instead of a silent secret leak. This is the belt-and-suspenders complement to keeping the module out of client code in the first place.
- **Install the `server-only` package** — it works by throwing when bundled for the browser; a comment that merely says "server only" does nothing.

## Examples

```tsx
// BAD — whole page is a Client Component just for one interactive button
'use client'
export default function ProductPage({ product }) { /* fetch + render + a button */ }

// GOOD — page stays a Server Component; only the interactive leaf opts in
export default function ProductPage({ product }) {
  return <><ProductInfo product={product} /><AddToCartButton id={product.id} /></>
}
// AddToCartButton.tsx → 'use client'
```

```ts
// BAD — module reads secrets but has no guard; a stray client import leaks them into the bundle
export const config = { clientSecret: getRequiredEnv('COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET') }

// GOOD — 'server-only' makes any browser-bound import fail at build time
import 'server-only'
export const config = { clientSecret: getRequiredEnv('COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET') }
```

## Gotchas

- `'use client'` is transitive downward: every module a Client Component imports becomes part of the client bundle, so a misplaced directive pulls far more than the one file into the browser.
- Server Components are the default — most files need **no** directive. Reach for `'use client'` only at an interaction boundary, and `import 'server-only'` only where a leak would be a real secret/bundle hazard.
