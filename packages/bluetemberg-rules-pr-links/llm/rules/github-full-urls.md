# Full GitHub URLs for PR and issue links

The `owner/repo#123` shorthand only becomes a clickable link inside GitHub's own UI, and only within that same repository. In a chat response, a commit message, a doc, or a cross-repo reference it renders as inert plain text, forcing the reader to reconstruct the URL by hand.

## Rules

- Link to PRs and issues with the full URL — `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123` or `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123` — not the `owner/repo#123` shorthand.
- Never assume a default `owner/repo`. Take it from the repository actually being discussed (its git remote, or the one named in the request).
- Never write a bare reference like `PR #123` or `#123` with no repo context — it's ambiguous outside the one page it was written on.
- When a short in-line mention of a PR/issue in a *different* repo is unavoidable, qualify it as `owner/repo#123` in plain prose, not as the link itself — the full URL remains the link.

## Examples

```md
<!-- BAD — shorthand doesn't render outside GitHub's own UI, and the repo is assumed -->
See #123 for context, discussed further in prototypdigital/bluetemberg-packs#106.

<!-- GOOD — full URL, works everywhere it's read -->
See [#123](https://github.com/prototypdigital/bluetemberg-packs/pull/123) for context,
discussed further in [prototypdigital/bluetemberg-packs#106](https://github.com/prototypdigital/bluetemberg-packs/pull/106).
```

## Gotchas

- This applies even inside the same repo's own README or docs — a reader viewing rendered Markdown outside GitHub (an IDE preview, a static site, a PDF export) still needs the full URL to follow the link.
- Commit messages and PR descriptions are read in many contexts beyond GitHub's PR view (git log, email notifications, changelog generators) — shorthand degrades in all of them.
