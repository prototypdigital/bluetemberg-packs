# payload-blocks

Use this skill when you add, edit, or render a Payload CMS block. A block is always two co-located files — a Payload schema and a React component — and is rendered through a registry dispatcher, never a hand-rolled `switch`. The goal: every block looks the same on disk, the renderer maps `blockType → Component` in one place, and shared context flows as explicit props rather than global state.

## Triggers

- Adding a new block (a CMS-authored content section).
- Editing a block's schema (`config.ts`) or its component.
- Adding or changing a `RenderBlocks` / `Render*Blocks` dispatcher.
- Adding a nested/sub-block inside an existing block config.

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Two co-located files per block

Every block lives in `src/blocks/{Domain}/{BlockName}/` and is exactly two files:

```text
src/blocks/Models/CallToAction/
  config.ts          → Payload schema: slug, interfaceName, fields, optional admin.images
  CallToAction.tsx   → React component, props = the generated block interface
```

- `config.ts` MUST set `interfaceName` so Payload generates a named type the component imports.
- Do not put the schema and component in one file, and do not scatter them across unrelated directories.

### Step 2 — Component consumes props; never re-queries

The component receives the resolved block data as props (typed by `interfaceName`). It MUST NOT call `fetch`/Payload local API inside itself — the parent page already resolved the block.

```tsx
// BAD — block re-queries data the page already loaded
function CallToAction(props: CallToActionBlock) {
  const data = await getPayload().find({ collection: 'cta' }) // duplicate query, breaks caching
}

// GOOD — pure render of injected props
function CallToAction({ heading, link, model }: CallToActionBlock & { model: Model }) {
  return <section>{heading}…</section>
}
```

### Step 3 — Dispatch through a registry, not a switch

`RenderBlocks` maps `blockType` to a component and guards membership. The union-type mismatch on spread is expected and suppressed deliberately.

```tsx
const blockComponents = { cta: CallToAction, hero: HomepageHero }

export function RenderModelBlocks({ blocks, model }: Props) {
  return blocks.map((block, i) => {
    const { blockType } = block
    if (!(blockType in blockComponents)) return null            // guard unknown types
    const Block = blockComponents[blockType as keyof typeof blockComponents]
    // @ts-expect-error — block union vs specific component props mismatch is expected here
    return <Block key={i} {...block} model={model} />
  })
}
```

```text
Adding a new block to a page?
  → add `blockType: Component` to that page's blockComponents registry
  → do NOT write a bespoke `switch (blockType)` per page
```

### Step 4 — Pass shared context as explicit props

Cross-block context (`model`, `locale`, theme) flows as named props through the renderer, not through React context/globals — so a block's data dependencies are visible in its signature.

### Step 5 — Sub-blocks stay in the same config

A nested block defined inside a parent's `config.ts` keeps its schema there; its component lives in a sibling file in the same block folder. Don't promote a sub-block to a top-level `src/blocks/` entry unless it is independently authorable.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Block is exactly `config.ts` + `{BlockName}.tsx`, co-located in `src/blocks/{Domain}/{BlockName}/`
- [ ] `config.ts` declares `slug` and `interfaceName`; the component is typed from that interface
- [ ] Component renders injected props only — no `fetch`/local-API calls inside a block
- [ ] New block registered in the page's `blockComponents` map; dispatch uses the `blockType in blockComponents` guard + `@ts-expect-error` spread
- [ ] Shared context (`model`, `locale`, …) passed as explicit props through the renderer
- [ ] Sub-blocks defined in the parent `config.ts`, components in sibling files

## When NOT to use

- Building a plain React component that is not a CMS-authored Payload block.
- Editing the Lexical rich-text config or a non-block field — that is collection/field work, not the block system.
