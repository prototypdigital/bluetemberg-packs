description: Every number in a deliverable carries its source and its basis; own data is never dressed as research.
scope: "**"

# Evidence citation

No number ships without a source next to it, and a measurement of yourself is never presented as a
general finding.

**Why:** an uncited number cannot be checked, so a single wrong one discredits every other number in
the document. Worse, an audience that cannot tell your own case study from published research will
assume you blurred the line deliberately the moment they spot one unsourced claim.

## Rules

- Every figure on a slide, in a summary, or in a report carries a source in the same view. A footer
  counts; a bibliography three pages away does not.
- Label the **basis** of each number, not just its origin. Three categories:
  - **own data** — your measurement. State the sample: `n=1 case study`, `293 PRs`, `41 active days`.
  - **research** — published, peer-reviewed. Give author, year, venue and sample size.
  - **preprint** — published but not peer-reviewed. Say so explicitly, every time.
- Say "in my data" for your own measurements. Never let a personal figure adopt the grammar of a
  general law.
- State the **window** for any time-bounded number. "1.28 billion requests" is meaningless without
  "over 15 months".
- When a source has a known limit that affects your use of it, state the limit where you use the
  number, not only in an appendix.
- If two defensible bases give different answers, report the **conservative** one and note the other.

## BAD

```md
77.5% of code ships without review. Reading it all would take 23.4 hours a day.
```

Whose code? Measured how? Over what window? Reading speed from where? Every one of these is
checkable and none of them is checkable as written.

## GOOD

```md
77.5% of the code I merged arrived in PRs above the 400-line ceiling.
  [my own data, n=234 merged PRs, 2026-04-29 to 07-29]

Reading it all would take 23.4 hours a day.
  [13.7M words / 238 wpm / 41 active days. Rate: Brysbaert 2019,
   J. Memory & Language, meta-analysis of 190 studies, n=18,573]
```

## Config

A citation component makes the rule enforceable rather than aspirational, because a slide without
one becomes visibly incomplete:

```vue
<Cite kind="own" source="293 PRs fetched individually" n="2026-04-29 → 07-29" />
<Cite kind="research" source="SmartBear / Cisco — 2,500 reviews, 3.2M LOC" />
<Cite kind="preprint" source="arXiv:2604.09388 — single author, n=1" />
```

## Gotchas

- **A number with two defensible bases needs the smaller one.** If 77.5% and 87.7% are both true
  under different definitions, use 77.5% and keep the other in the methodology. Being caught quoting
  the larger version costs more than the larger version ever gains.
- **Vendor surveys are not research.** Attribute them as vendor surveys.
- **Do not cite a summary of a paper as the paper.** Fetch the source before quoting its numbers; a
  search snippet is a lead, not a citation.
- Deriving a figure from a cited one makes it yours. Show the arithmetic.
