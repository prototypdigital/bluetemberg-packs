# Measure, don't proxy

Report what you measured, not what you inferred from a countable stand-in.

**Why:** a proxy that is easy to count is not the same as the thing you care about, and the gap
between them is usually large and usually in the flattering direction. Publishing a proxy as if it
were a measurement produces confident, wrong conclusions that survive until someone runs the real
check, at which point every other number you presented becomes suspect too.

## Rules

- If the real measurement can be obtained, obtain it. Install the dependencies, run the suite,
  execute the query, hit the endpoint.
- If you can only get a proxy, **label it a proxy in the same sentence as the number**, and state
  which direction it is likely to be wrong in.
- Never let a proxy graduate into a claim through repetition across documents. If it appears in a
  summary, it must carry its caveat there too.
- When a proxy and a measurement disagree, the measurement wins and the proxy gets deleted, not
  softened.
- Prefer proxies that are hard to game over proxies that are easy to compute.

## BAD

```md
mg-api has a 15.4% test-file ratio, so testing is weak.
```

Counted `*.test.*` files against source files. Fast, and wrong: it says nothing about how many test
cases exist, whether they pass, or whether anything runs them.

## GOOD

```bash
# get the real number
yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn test:cov
```

```md
mg-api has 206 suites, 2,396 tests and ~86% statement coverage.
No CI job executes any of them, and four suites currently fail on main.
```

The proxy suggested "weak testing". The measurement showed strong tests with no trigger, which is a
completely different problem with a completely different fix.

## When a proxy is genuinely all you have

```md
mg-motor-europe: 3.0% test-file ratio.
Proxy only — the suite was never executed here, so this counts files and not test cases.
Treat as a floor, not a finding.
```

## Gotchas

- **File counts, line counts and commit counts are all proxies.** They are the easiest numbers to
  get, which is exactly why they are the easiest to over-read.
- **Beware the second mistake**, which is correcting a proxy with a measurement and then
  over-generalising that measurement to things you did not measure. Two repos measured does not
  license a claim about twelve.
- Cached or stale artifacts count as a proxy. A `node_modules` from three weeks ago is not the state
  of `main`.
