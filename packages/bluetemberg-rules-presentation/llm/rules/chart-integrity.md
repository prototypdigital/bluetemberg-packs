# Chart integrity

A chart makes exactly one claim, names the threshold that makes it matter, and carries its caveat in
view.

**Why:** a chart is read in about three seconds, so whatever it implies in those three seconds is
what the audience takes away, regardless of what the speaker says over it. A technically true chart
that implies something false is worse than no chart, because it is persuasive.

## Rules

- **The claim is the title.** Not "PR size distribution" but "22.6% of my PRs contain 77.5% of my
  code". If you cannot title it as a claim, you do not yet know what the chart is for.
- **Annotate the threshold**, because the threshold usually *is* the argument. The 400-line review
  ceiling, the 24-hour day, the 4-chunk memory limit. A bar chart without its reference line is
  decoration.
- **If a chart needs two sentences to explain, split it into two charts.**
- **Put the caveat on the slide**, not in the notes. Partial periods, changed methodology, small
  samples and excluded categories all belong in the footer.
- **Never chart a metric that is true but misleading**, even when it is impressive. Ask what a
  reasonable person would wrongly conclude in three seconds, and if the answer is "something false",
  drop it.
- **Never present a partial period as a trend.** Either exclude it or label it.
- **Show both panels when one panel misleads.** If the aggregate hides a split that changes the
  conclusion, the split is not optional.
- Two colours plus one accent. Grey for context, accent for the finding. No pie charts.

## BAD

```text
Title:  "Weekend commits over time"
Chart:  2.4% → 34.0%
```

True, and it implies AI destroyed this person's weekends. Split by repository type, client work went
1% → 8% and personal tooling went 9% → 45%. The aggregate points at the wrong cause.

```text
Title:  "Context processed"
Chart:  3.28 billion tokens
```

True, and meaningless: cached context is re-read on every call, so this is not 3.28 billion tokens of
comprehension. Impressive and misleading is the worst combination.

## GOOD

```text
Title:  "AI didn't take my weekends. It gave me the capacity to take them myself."
Panel A: weekend share, pre-AI vs AI era
Panel B: the same, split client work vs own tooling   ← non-negotiable
Footer:  n=2,188 commits · author-local timestamps · commit time ≠ work time
```

```text
Title:  "22.6% of my pull requests contain 77.5% of my code"
Chart:  two stacked bars, normalised, inverted against each other
Marker: 400-line ceiling, labelled with its source
Footer: merged PRs only (n=234); the all-PRs basis reads 87.7% and is inflated by one closed PR
```

## Gotchas

- **Reveal order is part of the claim.** Showing the reassuring bar first and dropping the alarming
  one second is honest sequencing. Hiding a bar you never show is not.
- **A truncated y-axis is a lie by default.** If you truncate, say so on the axis.
- **Excluding outliers requires naming them.** "Excludes one 53,633-line PR" is a caveat; silently
  dropping it is data manipulation.
- **Derived metrics inherit every caveat of their inputs.** A ratio built on a proxy is a proxy.
- Growth rates and totals answer different questions. A total invites "is that a lot"; a rate does
  not. Pick deliberately.
