description: Log corrections in the artifact instead of silently fixing them.
scope: "**"

# Correction log

When a number, claim or conclusion changes, record what it was, what it became, and why. Do not
quietly overwrite it.

**Why:** a silent fix destroys the reader's ability to trust anything else in the document, because
they cannot tell which figures have been revised and which were right the first time. Volunteering
the correction costs one paragraph and buys more credibility than the original number ever could,
especially when the artifact's whole claim is that it is evidence-based.

## Rules

- Keep a corrections section in the artifact itself. Not in commit messages, not in chat history:
  those are not read by the person who reads the document.
- Each entry states: **the old claim**, **the new claim**, **how it was found**, and **what it
  changes**.
- Corrections that alter a headline figure get flagged where the figure appears, not only in the log.
- If a correction makes the story *less* dramatic, keep the less dramatic version and say why.
- Never delete a correction once logged, even after the artifact is finished. The log is the record.
- Record corrections in **both directions**, including cases where you overstated a fix.

## BAD

```md
77.5% of merged code arrived above the review ceiling.
```

Silently edited down from 87.7% after finding the earlier figure included a closed PR. A reader has
no way to know a revision happened, and no reason to trust the remaining numbers.

## GOOD

```md
## Corrections

1. **87.7% → 77.5%** unreviewable share. The first figure counted all PRs opened,
   including one 53,633-line PR that was closed and never merged. Recomputed on a
   merged-only basis. Use 77.5%: it is smaller and unimpeachable.

2. **"Barely any tests" → 2,396 tests at 86% coverage.** The first pass counted test
   files as a proxy. Installing and running the suite showed the opposite. See
   measure-dont-proxy.

3. **And then I overstated correction 2.** Both repos measured are pre-production, so
   "move fast now, harden before launch" is a fair description of them. Severity
   downgraded; claim narrowed to "untriggered tests rot".
```

## Gotchas

- **The log is a feature, not an apology.** Write it flatly. No self-flagellation, no hedging on the
  corrected number.
- **A correction that changes the conclusion belongs in the summary too.** Burying a
  conclusion-altering fix in a log at the bottom is still a silent fix.
- Do not use the log to relitigate. State what changed and move on.
- Corrections found by someone else get logged the same way, with the same neutrality.
